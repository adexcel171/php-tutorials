PHP is a server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded in HTML code and executed on the server, generating dynamic content that is then sent to the client's web browser. PHP is widely used for building dynamic websites and web applications.

Declaring a Variable in PHP:

In PHP, you can declare variables using the $ symbol followed by the variable name. Variable names are case-sensitive, and they must start with a dollar sign followed by a letter or underscore. Here's an example:

php
Copy code
<?php
$name = "John";
$age = 25;
$isStudent = true;
?>
In this example, three variables are declared: $name (a string), $age (an integer), and $isStudent (a boolean).

Writing a Function in PHP:

You can define functions in PHP using the function keyword. Here's an example of a simple function that adds two numbers:

php
Copy code
<?php
function addNumbers($num1, $num2) {
    $sum = $num1 + $num2;
    return $sum;
}

$result = addNumbers(5, 10);
echo "The sum is: " . $result;
?>
In this example:

addNumbers is the function name.
$num1 and $num2 are parameters passed to the function.
Inside the function, the sum of $num1 and $num2 is calculated and stored in the $sum variable.
The return statement is used to send the result back to the calling code.
The function is then called with arguments (5 and 10), and the result is stored in the $result variable and echoed to the screen.
Functions in PHP can have optional parameters, default values, and can return values. They provide a way to organize and reuse code in your PHP applications.
